%description
Tunnels ATA SMART commands over SCSI transports.  This allows ATA SMART checks
to work for SATA drives which are directly attached to a SATA controller a SAS
HBA or a SAS expander.  The SAT translation layer handles decpasulating the
ATA command at the relvant boundary between SCSI and SATA protocols.
